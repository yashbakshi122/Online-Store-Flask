## Repository Structure :deciduous_tree:

 <img src="images/struct.png">

Based on the directories present

* Model directory contains all the database model class and methods associated
 
* Resource directory contains api resource classes 

* Schemas is for the marshmallow schemas 

* Split contains sample code which can help you understand the code base

* Static is the directory where user images are uploaded

* Templates conatins html templates


## DataBase Architecture :desktop_computer:
```sh

There are mainly four schemas 

* Users - which contains details about the users
* Store - which contains details about the store
* Items - which contains details about the items
* Order - which is for ordering stuff

### DataBase Architecture

- store and item : one to many 
- item and order: many to many 


```

## Functionalities present

### 1) flask_jwt_extended
  - [Read about it here](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

  - flask jwt extended allows us to generate access and refresh tokens
  ```sh
        access_token = create_access_token(identity=user.id,fresh=True)
        refresh_token = create_refresh_token(user.id)

        return {
            "access_token": access_token,
            "refresh_token": refresh_token
        },200
   ```
    
  - For all post and put methods jwt token is required

  - Deletion requires a fresh jwt token so might prompt you to sign in again

### 2) flask restful
   - [Read about it here](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

   - Used for creating resource class

   - You can define the endpoints using flask restful
   ```sh
    class Item(Resource):
    
      def get(self):
          try:
              data = item_schema.load(request.get_json())
              print(data.name)
          except ValidationError as err:
              return err.messages,400
          print(data)
          name = data.name
          item = ItemModel.find_by_name(name)

          if item:
              return item_schema.dump(item)
          return {
              "msg": "Item not found"
          }
   ```

### 3) flask marshmallow
  - [Read about it here](https://flask-marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

  - flask marshmallow allows us to easily seralize and desarlize data 

  - Check marsh_app.py file under split directory which contains simple example of using flask marshmallow
  
   ```sh
        class RewardSchema(ma.SQLAlchemyAutoSchema):
            class Meta:
                model = Reward
                load_instance = True

        class MarshSchema(ma.SQLAlchemyAutoSchema):
            rewards = ma.Nested(RewardSchema,many=True)
            class Meta:
                model = Marsh
                load_instance = True

   ```
   
  - The example used above has been similarly implemented in the project

  - flask marshmallow latest version has syantax  different from previous versions 

  - marshamllow integrates well with SQLAlchemy 

### 4) OAuth2
   - [Read about it here](https://flask-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html)

   - For OAuth we are now using GitHub 

   - The relevant methods are in github_login file in resource directory 

   - Go to Github -> Settings -> Developer settings -> OAuth Apps and get your own client id and secret

   <img src="images/oauth.png">

   - Populate those values in .env to use github oauth

### 5) flask migrate 
   - [Read about it here](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

   - flask migrate can be used to migrate the database easily 

   - app.py under split folder contains sample code 

   ```sh
    Command used for migration 

      flask db migrate 

      This does the initial migration and creates the relevant files 

      flask db upgrade 

      This finally upgrades your database

  ```

### 6) flask mail

        mail.send(msg)
  ```
  
  - This is used for user confirmation during signup 

### 7) Stripe
   - [Read about it here](https://stripe.com/docs)

        card={
            "number": "4242424242424242",
            "exp_month": 9,
            "exp_year": 2021,
            "cvc": "314",
            }, )
     The values given here are all sample values 
   ```

   - For performing Indian payments we have to provide the following parameters
   ```sh
    stripe.Charge.create(
              amount=self.amount,
              currency=CURRENCY,
              description=self.description,
              source=token["id"],
              shipping={
                'name': "John",
                'address': {
                'line1': '510 Townsend St',
                'postal_code': '98140',
                'city': 'Kolkata',
                'state': 'WB',
                'country': 'India',
            }
        })
